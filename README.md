# This is an AdmitKard assignment  project otp verification

In this project, I have used Firebase for the database and React. js for frontend and for stylling css is used.
**Note: I am using Firebase; it has a limited request quota When the quota is over, you can't get a second page, so when you are visiting, it might happen that you are not on the second page.**
